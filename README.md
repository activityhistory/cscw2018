# Materials for Aiding Collaborative Reuse of Computational Notebooks

This repository contains the materials used to perform both studies for the paper [Aiding Collaborative Reuse of Computational Notebooks](http://adamrule.com/files/papers/cscw_2018_aiding_reuse_computational_web.pdf) accepted to [CSCW 2018](https://cscw.acm.org/2018/).

The notebooks folder contains the example and study notebooks used for Study 1 in the paper. Data for the analysis task may be found at https://www.kaggle.com/zillow/zecon. The housing_analysis_folded.ipynb notebook contains the metadata needed to show a folded version of the notebook with the [Janus](https://github.com/acrule/janus) extension to Jupiter Notebook.

The materials folder includes interview guides for both studies and the questionnaire given to Study 1 participants after the study session to measure their comprehension of the notebook and familiarity with basic data analysis and manipulation in Python.
